<h2>London</h2>
<p>London is the capital and most populous city of England the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millenia. It was founded bby the Romans, who named it Londinium. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries and in 2011 had a resitant population of 7,375, making it the smallest city in England. Since at least the 19th century,the term London has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core. The bulk of this conurbation forms Greater London, a region of England governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. The conurbation also covers two English counties: the small district of the City of London and the county of Greater London. The latter constitutes the vast majority of London, though historically it was split between Middlesex (a now abolished county), Essex, Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire.</p>
